# Template/Styleguide for NYSTHI Manpages

Intended for use in a monospace text editor such as Notepad++. If you need to copy/paste from the Github page, click the "Raw" button just above and to the right of this section of the page. That way you won't strip the Markdown formatting or add extra HTML crap.

>If a *, #, or ` looks out of place to you, but you're not well-versed in Github-Flavoured Markdown syntax, just leave it be ;-)

## Functions by Section

### Section A

*[The sections should be in reference to the image - see MetaAardvark for a great example.]*

Try and describe what the control **does**, what voltage range a CV Input accepts, the kind of signal an output generates, etc. Usage has its own section, so please try and limit descriptions to specific controls here.

FUNCTION NAMES should be in ALL CAPS.

If you need to add a specification in a text block, try to be as clear as possible, e.g. "-666.00 V to +666.00 V ***(Default: 0.00 V)*** ". If you can't fit the phrase inline, separate it out like these:

***Default Clock Rate: 10.00 Hz***

***Min Clock Rate: 0.01 Hz***

***(Anything between 3 \*s will be in bold -and- italic)***

### Section B

If you need to write in point form:
- Type [dash], [space], then type your first-level items.
  - [space] [space] [dash] [space] to start your second-level items.
- Don't add extra lines between list items.

Start writing normally again (no extra dashes and spaces, an extra ) once you have finished writing your list.

## Sample Patches

\[typethefullpatchname.vcv] \(\./typethefullpatchname.vcv) 

- Save the patch in the same folder. Please don't link to external services, since they're not owned by Microsoft (like Github), and who knows if/when they'll go down?

If your patch isn't self-evident based on how you've described the module above, try and include some kind of basic write-up.
